## Dressed to kill

She sure looks good
Oh, she’s all right
She’s out of wood
Keep her warm tonight

**refrain**

In her neighbourhood
Well, there’s this guy
If it’s allowed
He’ll look for fun tonight

When they met
Sparkle in their eyes
Oh she was wet
Was it raining that night ?

**refrain**

*couplet*

**pont**

**refrain / solo**

*couplet*
