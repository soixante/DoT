## There's no use

Oh there’s no use  
To talk to the youth  
They’ll come up to  
Take your crown  

I’ve been told  
That growing old  
Will bring you ups  
And bring you down  

*Following their rules will turn you mad*
*Following their rulse will turn you*

What did mislead me ?  
wanted to stay free  
I’m in their office  
on their ground now  

that’s no joke  
you got to rope me  
before I commit a crime  

*Following their rules will turn you mad*
*Following their rulse will turn you*

what did you do to me  
that made me feel so free  
that made me so fine  
now I wanna drown
