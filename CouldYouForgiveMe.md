## Could you forgive me

Ô lord  
Did I make it on time  
I got a last song on my mind  
I got to find one last rhyme  
To make people feel good  
I hope they understood  
Could you forgive me  
 
Ô lord  
Did I make it all right  
I gave a last hug to my son  
I needed to cheer my daughter on  
To make me feel good  
And you said I misunderstood  
Could you forgive me  

And yes,  
Did I pass the test  
Can I look you right in the eyes  
Can I face all my lies  
Without having to kneel  
Or run down the hill  
Could you forgive me  

Ô lord  
And I made it on time  
There was the last song on my mind  
I finally found the last rhyme  
To make you feel good  
I hope you understood  
Could they forgive me
